# Stock Market Data Analysis

This project analyzes stock market data using Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The objective is to explore trends, volatility, and relationships among stocks.

## Key Sections

### Data Cleaning and Exploration:
- Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) are calculated to ensure data integrity.
- Outlier detection is performed to identify any anomalies in the dataset.

### Time Series Analysis:
- Line charts visualize closing prices over time.
- Daily percentage changes highlight price volatility, and moving averages (15-day and 30-day) are applied to smooth the data and reveal trends.
- The average closing prices for stocks are computed, identifying the top and bottom five stocks.

### Volatility Analysis:
- The rolling standard deviation of closing prices is plotted to assess market volatility.
- Daily price changes are analyzed, and significant price movements are highlighted.
- Stocks with unusually high trading volumes are also identified.

### Correlation and Heatmaps:
- The relationship between trading volume and volatility is explored.
- A correlation matrix between Open, High, Low, and Close prices is calculated.
- A heatmap visualizes these correlations, providing insights into stock relationships.
